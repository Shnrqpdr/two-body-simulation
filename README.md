# two-body-simulation
This project are a simulation of two bodies interacting in a gravitational field. 

The project has two classes to plot and animate the orbits of these bodies.
The used parameters is the set of parameters for the earth-moon system, i.e, can be found on google at wikipedia.

If you have any doubt or need support to modify these programs, contact me at hnrqpdr.sc@gmail.com or on the linkedin listed in my github.

Cheers,
Pedro.
